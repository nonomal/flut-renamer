# Flut Renamer

**Flut Renamer** is a powerful yet easy-to-use tool designed to help users manage and rename files and directories. No more manually renaming one by one – our app offers various features including inserting text, file metadata, and Exif data, replacing text, deleting text, rearranging, and more, allowing you to quickly batch rename files according to your needs.

"**Flut**" is derived from "**Flutter**", indicating that the app is built using the Flutter framework, and "Flut" means "flood" or "tide" in German, implying that this app can batch rename files as swiftly as floods or tidal waves.

* Multiple renaming options: Easily achieve batch file renaming by inserting, replacing, deleting text, and rearranging.
* Insert file metadata and Exif data: Extract information from file metadata and Exif data to insert it into the file name.
* Completely open-source and free: Flut Renamer is entirely open-source and contains no advertisements or in-app purchases, allowing you to use it freely at any time.
* Cross-platform compatibility: Built on the Flutter framework, Flut Renamer can run on multiple operating systems, enabling you to use it anytime, anywhere.

## Known issues or limitations 

### Android

Android provides drag-and-drop files as content URIs, which cannot be renamed, so we need to convert them to absolute paths.

Drag-and-dropped files from the [AOSP Files app](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/22/android-o-feature-spotlight-downloads-app-now-files-new-features/) and [Files by Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files) are not allowed to get an absolute path, so drag-and-drop from them is not supported.

Drag-and-drop works fine with Solid Explorer and OnePlus File Explorer.

### iOS

There are two steps to pick files on iOS, first choose the directory where your files are located. Then, within the selected folder, pick the files you want to rename. Due to the system restrictions, we have to use the two-step process. Otherwise, Flut Renamer can not rename picked files.

The [`desktop_drop`](https://pub.dev/packages/desktop_drop) library does not have iOS support yet, so drag-and-drop is not available on iOS. 

I tried a few other libraries, such as [`super_drag_and_drop`](https://pub.dev/packages/super_drag_and_drop), which fails to provide the path to the dropped file, and [`native_drag_n_drop`](https://pub.dev/packages/native_drag_n_drop), which copies the file into the app's sandbox directory. None of them provide the path to the original file, so renaming dropped files is impossible.

(In fact, I have no Apple development experience at all, and I don’t even know the Swift language. The iOS and macOS native code were completed with the following links as references: [Writing custom platform-specific code](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/platform-channels?tab=type-mappings-swift-tab#type-mappings-swift-tab), [Providing access to directories](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/providing_access_to_directories), [juanmartin/renamerApp-ios](https://github.com/juanmartin/renamerApp-ios). Therefore, if there are any errors in the Swift code, please feel free to point them out by opening an issue or a pull request. I'll be very grateful to you.)
